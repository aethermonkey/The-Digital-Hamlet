# Local Systems

The local systems within a Digital Hamlet are designed to operate independently and provide all necessary services for the Hamlet's functioning. These systems include:

- **Holochain**: For distributed data storage and peer-to-peer application logic.
- **Local Database**: A combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to store and manage local data efficiently.
- **Agent Foundry**: The development and maintenance hub for AI agents within the Hamlet.
- **Geography**: A geographical framework that will be used to model the Hamlet. This will also contribute to a geographical representation of connected hamlets and presumably the whole world wide network of hamlets.
- **Agency Foundry**: the basis of default local agencies and the abstract class for the creation of new agencies as required.

# External Systems

External systems facilitate interaction with the broader network of Hamlets and other external services. Key components include:

- **ActivityPub**: For social networking and communication between Hamlets.
- **IPFS**: For distributed file storage and sharing across the network.
- **Digital Currency Protocols**: Standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 for token interoperability and transactions.

# Bridging Systems

Bridging systems ensure seamless integration and communication between the local and external systems, maintaining the autonomy of the Hamlet while enabling collaboration and interoperability.

# Agent Foundry

The Agent Foundry is the cornerstone of the Digital Hamlet's development, responsible for creating and refining AI agents. It is the first system to be developed, setting the foundation for the Hamlet's growth and evolution.
