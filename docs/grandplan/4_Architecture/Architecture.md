# Core architectures

## Holochain

A Framework for distributed peer-to-peer applications and storing data hashes

### libp2p

Modular networking library for peer-to-peer connections

### Whisper

Secure communication protocol for private messaging

### ActivityPub

Federated social networking standard

### Solidity

Smart contract language (optional for additional consensus)

### Languages

#### Rust

Programming language for building core Holochain applications

#### Python/JS

APIs, command line tools, integrations

#### WebAssembly

Compiles Rust to WASM for client-side applications

#### IPFS

Content-addressed storage and distribution

#### Web Apps

Frontends using frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte

#### Data Schema

Schema.org, decentralized identifiers  

#### Crypto

Signatures, encryption with libraries like NaCl, Ed25519

#### Tokens

Digital currencies using standards like ERC-20, 721

#### Databases

SQL, NoSQL like LevelDB or Pebble embedded in Holochain

#### Operational

Service managers, analytics, monitoring, upgrades  

#### Deployment

Docker, Kubernetes for packaging and runtime orchestration

#### Networking

PeerDiscovery, TCP/IP, DHT protocols, circuit relaying

#### Standards

Interoperability, decentralized fault tolerance, coordination

The goal is selecting robust, production-ready open technologies following decentralized architectures and principles to realize the vision at scale
