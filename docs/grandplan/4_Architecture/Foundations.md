## Local Hamlet Infrastructure:

### Data storage:

Local SQL and VectorDB storages bridging to Holochain's distributed hash table for permitted data across nodes

### Messaging: 

Holochain's DHT handles encrypted peer-to-peer messaging

### Applications: 

Built as Holochain applications using languages like Rust

### Identity: 

Nodes have cryptographic identities provided by Holochain. user / agents also have unique cryptographic identities to ensure standardised identity in and out of the Hamlet.

### File Storage: 

IPFS could provide distribution, but local data storage system to ensure privacy of Hamlet stores.

### External Connectivity:

- Holochain's DHT allows peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes

- ActivityPub enables interoperability with outside decentralized networks

- DIDs could help with external identity interoperability

### Bridging Local & External:

Application routes messages and files according to permissions

User defines permission profiles for each Agent type (read, send, etc.)

Border Agent only allows information flow as specified in profiles

Profiles can be modified by User at any time to tighten/loosen access

### Additional Features:

Schemas like Schema.org promote common data vocabularies

This foundation utilizes Holochain's robust capabilities for the local infrastructure while maintaining the user's control over external connections. All components work together in a decentralized manner without unnecessary dependencies.
