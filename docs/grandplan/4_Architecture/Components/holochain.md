# Holochain Architecture for Digital Hamlet

## Overview

The Holochain framework will serve as the backbone for the decentralized Digital Hamlet, enabling peer-to-peer networking, data integrity, and autonomous agent interactions. Each Hamlet will be an independent Holochain application with its own DNA, consisting of multiple zomes that encapsulate specific functionalities.

### Agent and User Parity

To ensure a consistent and autonomous interaction model within the Digital Hamlet, both AI agents and the sovereign user will inherit from a common class that provides foundational capabilities. This class will enable both entities to perform tasks, communicate, and update settings, ensuring parity in terms of interaction possibilities. While agents and users will have distinct roles, characteristics, and permissions, this shared basis is crucial for the autonomy of AI agents and the seamless integration of user actions within the system.

- `communication` Zome Capabilities: Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging, social media interactions, and communication channels.
  Entry Types: `message` (sender, receiver, content, timestamp), `post` (author, content, visibility, timestamp), `encryption_key` (user_id, public_key).

- `governance` Zome Capabilities: Proposal submissions, voting systems, policy enforcement, and governance structure management.
  Entry Types: `constitution_document` (title, content, version), `amendment_proposal` (proposal_id, description, proposed_by), `governance_policy` (policy_id, description, enforced_by).

- `economy` Zome Capabilities: Currency issuance, transaction processing, account management, and economic analytics.
  Entry Types: `currency` (name, symbol, issuer), `transaction` (from, to, amount, currency, timestamp), `account_balance` (user_id, currency, balance).

- `dispute_resolution` Zome Capabilities: Dispute submission, case management, resolution tracking, and VeritasSuprema updates.
  Entry Types: `dispute_case` (case_id, parties_involved, description), `resolution` (resolution_id, dispute_case_id, outcome), `veritas_update` (update_id, changes, applied_by).

### VeritasSupremaDNA

- **Description**: This DNA governs the constitutional framework of a Hamlet.
- **Zomes**:
  - `constitution`: Manages the constitutional documents and amendment processes.
  - `ratification`: Handles the voting and consensus mechanisms for changes.

Data Validation Rules:

- All entries must be signed by the agent's key associated with the action.
- User profiles and agent keys must be unique and verifiable.
- Governance proposals require a quorum and majority approval to pass.

Consensus Protocols:

- Ratification of constitutional amendments follows a multi-round voting process with a supermajority threshold.
- Transaction validation involves a double-entry check to ensure balance consistency.
- Dispute resolutions are subject to peer review by randomly selected and anonymized agents within the Hamlet.

## Zomes

### Identity Zome

- **Capabilities**: Manages user profiles, agent public keys, and identity verification.
- **Entry Types**: `user_profile`, `agent_key`, `verification_record`

TODO: Implement identity verification protocols and integrate with external identity services.

### Communication Zome

- **Capabilities**: Enables direct messaging, public posts, and encrypted communications.
- **Entry Types**: `message`, `post`, `encryption_key`

TODO: Design the encryption and privacy model for secure communications.

### Governance Zome

- **Capabilities**: Supports the creation and modification of local constitutions and governance structures.
- **Entry Types**: `constitution_document`, `amendment_proposal`, `governance_policy`

TODO: Develop a flexible amendment proposal system that can handle various types of changes.

### Economy Zome

- **Capabilities**: Manages the issuance, transfer, and accounting of local digital currencies.
- **Entry Types**: `currency`, `transaction`, `account_balance`

TODO: Integrate with external blockchain or DLT systems for global currency interoperability.

### Dispute Resolution Zome

- **Capabilities**: Provides a framework for adjudicating disputes and updating the VeritasSuprema.
- **Entry Types**: `dispute_case`, `resolution`, `veritas_update`

TODO: Create a transparent and fair dispute resolution process that aligns with the VeritasSuprema.

## Integration with External Systems

The Holochain architecture must ensure seamless integration with external systems such as IPFS for file storage, ActivityPub for social networking, and various digital currency protocols.

Interfaces and Protocols for Interoperability:
- IPFS integration will use the HTTP API for file storage and retrieval.
- ActivityPub will be implemented for social networking via a custom Holochain-ActivityPub bridge.
- Digital currency protocols will adhere to standardized APIs for cross-chain transactions and wallet services.

## Security Considerations

Security and privacy are paramount in the design of the Holochain architecture. Measures must be taken to protect user data, ensure secure communications, and prevent unauthorized access.

Security Measures:
- Implement end-to-end encryption for all communications using established cryptographic protocols (e.g., AES, RSA).
- Regular security audits conducted by third-party firms to assess vulnerabilities and compliance with best practices.
- Use of secure, decentralized identity verification services to enhance privacy and reduce the risk of identity theft.

## Conclusion

The Holochain architecture for the Digital Hamlet is designed to be modular, secure, and adaptable to the evolving needs of decentralized communities. By carefully defining the DNAs and zomes, we can create a resilient and flexible framework that empowers users and fosters collaboration.

TODO: Continuously review and update the architecture to incorporate new technologies and address emerging challenges.
