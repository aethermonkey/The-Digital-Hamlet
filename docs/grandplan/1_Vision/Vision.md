# A Vision for Decentralized Digital Communities

The Digital Hamlet framework seeks to empower individuals through the creation of decentralized autonomous sociotechnical communities online. The user is the sole occupant of a Hamlet, and the Hamlet learns and develops inline with the user, forever striving to enrich the life of the individual. At its core are the following components:

## Hamlet Nodes  

Each Hamlet is an independent node in a decentralised network of individuals. Hamlets can connect to other Hamlets. An example might be, a group of friends, each with their own hamlet connect together to form a regional subnet. Regional subnets might then conjoin to create larger subnets. Conjoining Hamlets share common beliefs, goals, and intentions. This is just an example, and connected Hamlets could represent common values at all levels of life.

## Intra-Hamlet Activity

Within a Hamlet, **The Sovereign User** (the user) presides over a community of autonomous AI agents, all located in geographically distinct locations.

### VeritasSuprema (Constitution)

The VeritasSuprema is an ever changing set of articles. Articles and ammendments reflect the deepest and most sincere wants, desires, goals, aspirations, and beliefs of the user. As the Sovereign Right Hand (a specialist ai agent) communicates with the user, teams of specialised agents review and modify the VeritasSuprema to ensure it represents as closely as possible, their Sovereign.  

In addition to the very personal aspect of the VeritasSuprema, there also exists articles that consist of shared beliefs, desires, goals, etc between connected Hamlets, and to greater subnets, ultimately leading to a VeritasSuprema that represents a democratic reading of all shared values derived through consensus and advanced analysis of the corpus of Hamlet VeritasSupremas.

### VeritasSuprema & Global Coordination

A DAG consensus system like IOTA ensures harmonization at an internet scale. Constitutional conventions bring representatives together to draft amendments vetted through localized ratification processes.

Each Hamlet generates a unique VeritasSuprema constitution defined by its sovereign user. These local constitutions are enforced through smart contracts on the Holochain DHT.

Representatives periodically convene constitutional conventions to discuss region-specific topics. They jointly draft proposed amendments which require ratification votes from interconnected hamlets.

Ratified updates are integrated into each hamlet's constitution as optional shared rules/guidelines at the regional scale. This facilitates coordination on common challenges.

Global conventions propose amendments vetted through iterative feedback. Upon consensus, updates trigger smart contract changes propagating amendments uniformly yet flexibly across all hamlet constitutions.

By employing a standardized constitutional schema and semantic ontologies, frameworks can automatically parse, merge and propagate localized, regional and global elements over time.

This balances ideological diversity across sovereign hamlets with means for representatives to identify mutual interests and discuss approaches to boundary issues in a deliberative process. It helps avoid fragmentation while respecting self-determination.

The evolving multi-level VeritasSuprema system aims to cultivate harmonization without compromising each hamlet community's autonomy or unique character. Local guides global in a coherent constitutional structure.

### Agencies And Specialist Agents

Agencies and their specialist agents play administrative and Hamlet focussed roles, attending to the affairs of the community. Default agencies are: Sovereign Institution, Court, Central Bank, Bank, Library, Agency Foundry, Agent Foundry, Towncenter, foreign affairs (central point for external interaction), municipal services (code management and development), among others. 

### Resident Agents

Resident agents live and work in defined residential locations.  Resident agents are created in the Agent Foundry as required, being given traits and qualities not dissimilar to the traits of characters in RPG games. These varying qualities will allow agents to perform different tasks in different ways. The Agent Foundry studies the output, efficacy, successes and failures of resident agents, to find what works best and what doesn't work at all.

Resident agents gather in the **Towncenter** for the purposes of intra-hamlet collaboration, public information, interaction, and commercial activities. The Towncenter has bulletin boards, public gatherings, and other facilities to allow fluid cooperation within the Hamlet. The VeritasSuprema is displayed here for all to see, and information and news from throughout the Hamlet is disseminated to visitors of the Towncenter.

Resident agents use the VeritasSuprema to synthesise new project ideas that align with the Hamlet. These agents then take these ideas and plan projects that they take to the bank for approval. The bank assesses projects on merit to the extent that they satisfy the VeritasSuprema. The resident agents then receive local currency to begin their project. Projects might be as simple as setting a morning routine of alarms, news, and travel time to work. However, projects could be as extensive as starting businesses, monitoring user's health, or any objective the user can think up. It is worth noting that in the current monetary system we live in, agents could potentially commence projects that involve real world money. For example, an agent might start a for profit website, and require real world funds to complete the project. These sorts of projects will be assessed by the bank accordingly, being approved or denied,

## Inter-Hamlet Links

Connected Hamlets synchronize relevant entries across one another's destributed information processing systems. Communication pathways exchange messages, create social relationships, facilitate collaboration, manage regional currency exchange, among many other tasks. Regional subnets foster inter-Hamlet cooperation on shared issues and projects. There are no limitations on the level of interaction, however, a default set of tasks and activities will be deployed for the base release.

## Digital economies

Each Hamlet mints its own localized currency, while a shared global currency enables borderless value exchange. Dual cryptocurrency systems balance localized autonomy and distributed participation.

Real world currency will likely have to be incorporated into the platform so as to facilitate projects that earn real world money, like businesses. There are obviously risks involved in this aspect of the platform. Due dilligence should be taken when planning interactions that require the user's actual money. This aspect should be considered after the platform is operating to some degree of success.

## Dispute Resolution

Local hamlet disputes arise when an ai agent has in some way challenged or contravened the VeritasSuprema.  The **Court** provides a way for agents to have their case heard, involving prosecution and defence. Decisions in these cases then contribute to the maintenance of the VeritasSuprema.

At a greater regional scale, different levels of technical remediation and justice ought to allow for fluid resolution of disputes, and adaptation of the many levels of VeritasSuprema.

## Governance Structures

Decentralized governance facilities (specialist hamlets facilitating inter-hamlet cooperation) contribute to constitutional evolution and regional coordination to ensure sovereignty and enable scaling. Representation and deliberative processes promote inclusiveness and equality. The pseudo-political structures to be implemented are not set in stone and are derived from the constituent collaborators connected in these self-organising subnets of hamlets. To that extent, the governing practices of one subnet might be incompatible to other subnets. If 2 subnets want to connect, negotiation and adaptation needs to take place to align processes.

## Interoperability

While still early stages, there ought to be a way for this foundational framework to branch off and allow other similar frameworks to coincide heterogeneously.

What standards facilitate semantic understanding across variations?

## Security and privacy

Identity keys and encryption protocols ensure authenticated and confidential communications within and across Hamlets. Redundancy and fallback strategies help maintain resilience against potential attacks or disruptions.

By implementing emerging decentralized technologies through a holistic framework, Digital Hamlets aim to realize Living Networks - harmonized yet self-determined communities as autonomous nodes promising emancipatory potential at a global scale.

Particular focus on Hamlet isolation of private information is imperative to preserve self-determination, privacy and autonomy. This means that much of the Hamlet code should be separate from the decentralised network of subnets. The Foreign Affairs agency and Central Bank should act as border control of information and interaction. 

In particular, a strong system of agent permissions needs to be implemented to ensure only appropriately permitted agents can interact with other hamlets. These permissions also apply within the Hamlet, ensuring that appropriate agents are permitted to access intra-hamlet information and services.  For example, the librarian is exclusively responsible for database storage and infomormation disemination. An ambassador agent is soley responsible for representing the hamlet at inter-hamlet interactions.

## Maintenance and sustainability

The Digital Hamlet Framework will be underpinned by a specific department of ai agents tasked with further developing, maintaining, and updating the underlying sourcecode.  This role will be entrusted to founding hamlets initially.  Longterm, the framework will adjust who is granted this prestigious role based on a wider consensus, always ensuring the platform is updated autonomously, and with the best interest of the users.  There enlies the possibility for subnets to essentially create their own forks, where the code between subnets might change.  

However, there will need to remain a high tier standard that is upheld by all to atleast ensure interoperability between all hamlets on the network.
