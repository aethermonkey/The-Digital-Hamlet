# A Vision for Decentralized Digital Communities

The Digital Hamlet framework seeks to empower individuals through the creation of decentralized autonomous sociotechnical communities online. The user is the sole occupant of a Hamlet, and the Hamlet learns and develops inline with the user, forever striving to enrich the life of the individual. At its core are the following components:

## Hamlet Nodes  

Each Hamlet is an independent node in a decentralised network of individuals. Hamlets can connect to other Hamlets. An example might be, a group of friends, each with their own hamlet connect together to form a regional subnet. Regional subnets might then conjoin to create larger subnets. Conjoining Hamlets share common beliefs, goals, and intentions. This is just an example, and connected Hamlets could represent common values at all levels of life.

## Intra-Hamlet Activity

Within a Hamlet, **The Sovereign User** (the user) presides over a community of autonomous AI agents, all located in geographically distinct locations.

### VeritasSuprema (Constitution)

The VeritasSuprema is an ever changing set of articles. Articles and ammendments reflect the deepest and most sincere wants, desires, goals, aspirations, and beliefs of the user. As the Sovereign Right Hand (a specialist ai agent) communicates with the user, teams of specialised agents review and modify the VeritasSuprema to ensure it represents as closely as possible, their Sovereign.  

In addition to the very personal aspect of the VeritasSuprema, there also exists articles that consist of shared beliefs, desires, goals, etc between connected Hamlets, and to greater subnets, ultimately leading to a VeritasSuprema that represents a democratic reading of all shared values derived through consensus and advanced analysis of the corpus of Hamlet VeritasSupremas.

### Agencies And Specialist Agents

Agencies and their specialist agents play administrative and Hamlet focussed roles, attending to the affairs of the community. Default agencies are: Sovereign Institution, Central Bank, Bank, Library, Agency Foundry, Agent Foundry, Towncenter, foreign affairs (central point for external interaction), municipal services (code management and development), among others. 

### Resident Agents

Resident agents live and work in defined residential locations.  Resident agents are created in the Agent Foundry as required, being given traits and qualities not dissimilar to the traits of characters in RPG games. These varying qualities will allow agents to perform different tasks in different ways. The Agent Foundry studies the output, efficacy, successes and failures of resident agents, to find what works best and what doesn't work at all.

Resident agents gather in the **Towncenter** for the purposes of intra-hamlet collaboration, public information, interaction, and commercial activities. The Towncenter has bulletin boards, public gatherings, and other facilities to allow fluid cooperation within the Hamlet. The VeritasSuprema is displayed here for all to see, and information and news from throughout the Hamlet is disseminated to visitors of the Towncenter.

## Inter-Hamlet Links

Connected Hamlets synchronize relevant entries across one another's destributed information processing systems. Communication pathways exchange messages, create social relationships, facilitate collaboration, manage regional currency exchange, among many other tasks. Regional subnets foster inter-Hamlet cooperation on shared issues and projects. There are no limitations on the level of interaction, however, a default set of tasks and activities will be deployed for the base release.

## VeritasSuprema (constitutions) & Global coordination

A DAG consensus system like IOTA ensures harmonization at an internet scale. Constitutional conventions bring representatives together to draft amendments vetted through localized ratification processes.

Each Hamlet generates a unique VeritasSuprema constitution defined by its sovereign user. These local constitutions are enforced through smart contracts on the Holochain DHT.

Representatives periodically convene constitutional conventions to discuss region-specific topics. They jointly draft proposed amendments which require ratification votes from interconnected hamlets.

Ratified updates are integrated into each hamlet's constitution as optional shared rules/guidelines at the regional scale. This facilitates coordination on common challenges.

Global conventions propose amendments vetted through iterative feedback. Upon consensus, updates trigger smart contract changes propagating amendments uniformly yet flexibly across all hamlet constitutions.

By employing a standardized constitutional schema and semantic ontologies, frameworks can automatically parse, merge and propagate localized, regional and global elements over time.

This balances ideological diversity across sovereign hamlets with means for representatives to identify mutual interests and discuss approaches to boundary issues in a deliberative process. It helps avoid fragmentation while respecting self-determination.

The evolving multi-level VeritasSuprema system aims to cultivate harmonization without compromising each hamlet community's autonomy or unique character. Local guides global in a coherent constitutional structure.

## Digital economies

Each Hamlet mints its own localized currency, while a shared global currency enables borderless value exchange. Dual cryptocurrency systems balance localized autonomy and distributed participation.

## Dispute resolution

Local hamlet disputes are essentially where an ai agent has in someway challenged or contravened the VeritasSuprema.  The framework provides a court like system for agents to have their case heard. Decisions in these cases then modify the VeritasSuprema.

Likewise, it could be envisioned that at a regional scale, some technical solution might allow for fluid resolution of disputes.

## Governance structures

Decentralized governance facilitates constitutional evolution and regional coordination within a overarching schema to maintain sovereignty and enable scaling. Representation and deliberative processes promote coordination.

## Agents and users

Autonomous AI agents carry out tasks and activities within ethical and legal paradigms defined by sovereign human users. Dashboards provide oversight and tools for participatory guidance of Hamlet dynamics.  

## Network Structure

Hamlets (nodes) are connected via subnets which represent groupings of interest aligned individiuals. Subnets can group further arbitrarily. The primary conception is that common beliefs, ideologies, and goals of individuals can organically draw together likeminded groups in a collaborative and self-organising fashion.

## Interoperability

While still early stages, there ought to be a way for this foundational framework to branch off and allow other similar frameworks to coincide heterogeneously.

What standards facilitate semantic understanding across variations?

## Security and privacy

Identity keys and encryption protocols like Whisper ensure authenticated and confidential communications within and across Hamlets. Redundancy and fallback strategies help maintain resilience against potential attacks or disruptions.

By implementing emerging decentralized technologies through a holistic framework, Digital Hamlets aim to realize Living Networks - harmonized yet self-determined communities as autonomous nodes promising emancipatory potential at a global scale.

## Maintenance and sustainability

The Digital Hamlet Framework will be underpinned by a specific department of ai agents tasked with further developing, maintaining, and updating the underlying sourcecode.  This role will be entrusted to founding hamlets initially.  Longterm, the framework will adjust who is granted this prestigious role based on a wider consensus, always ensuring the platform is updated autonomously, and with the best interest of the users.  There enlies the possibility for subnets to essentially create their own forks, where the code between subnets might change.  

However, there will need to remain a high tier standard that is upheld by all to atleast ensure interoperability between all hamlets on the network.
