# Local Interactions within a Holochain Hamlet

In Holochain, interactions within a single application (hApp) occur through a shared Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is a key component of the Holochain architecture. However, it's important to understand that the DHT is not just a mechanism for spreading information across a decentralized network; it also allows for localized interactions within a specific context, such as a single hApp or "Hamlet" in this case.

**ToDo:** *Discern whether SQL databases need to be employed at a local level or if local data can be stored in the DHT*

Here's how local interactions within a Hamlet can work:

1. **Local Context**: Each Holochain application has its own separate DHT, which means that all interactions within a Hamlet's hApp are local to that specific DHT. Even though the DHT is distributed among all participants, the data and interactions are relevant only to that particular hApp instance.

*Does this secure local hamlet data or is there a risk of this data spreading beyond the Hamlet?*

2. **Agent Interactions**: Both users and AI agents interact with the DHT by publishing and retrieving data. When an agent performs an action, such as sending a message or making a transaction, this action is recorded as an entry on the local DHT of the Hamlet's hApp.

3. **Data Integrity**: The DHT ensures data integrity through cryptographic signatures and validation rules. Every entry published to the DHT is signed by the agent's private key, and other participants in the network validate these entries according to the hApp's rules.

4. **Direct Messaging**: Holochain also supports direct peer-to-peer messaging between agents, which does not rely on the DHT. This can be used for real-time or private communications that don't need to be stored on the DHT.

*Does this mean to store all conversations an SQL database would infact be needed?*

5. **Microservices**: If you require more localized interactions that don't fit the DHT model, you can integrate microservices within your hApp. These microservices can manage local state and perform computations that are specific to a single node or a group of nodes.

6. **Private Entries**: Holochain allows for the creation of private entries that are stored locally on an agent's device and not shared on the DHT. This can be used for data that should only be accessible within the local context of a Hamlet.

7. **DNA Instances**: Each Holochain DNA can be thought of as a blueprint for a hApp. Multiple instances of the same DNA can be run, each creating a separate DHT. This allows for the creation of multiple independent Hamlets, each with its own local interactions and data.

*I think this answers my questions*

In summary, while the DHT is a distributed system, it supports localized interactions within the context of a single hApp. In your Digital Hamlet, both users and AI agents can interact locally within the Hamlet by publishing and retrieving data from the Hamlet's DHT, using direct messaging, or through private entries and microservices. The design of your hApp will determine how these interactions are structured and managed.
