# Hamlet types

## Default hamlet

The default hamlet is the primary offering to users. The hamlet has autonomy from the greater network but can connect to other Hamlets to form subnets, which can then connect to other subnets to create larger subnets. Default Hamlets are designed to serve the user.

## Social Hamlet

Social Hamlets are distributed ActivityPub pods or servers catering to an associated subnet of hamlets. These servers are run by the members of the subnet and can interact with other connected subnets. Alternatively, multiple subnets might choose to consolidate hamlets into 1 social hamlet. One day this might act like a virtual reality space.

## Interhamlet Relations Hamlet

Interhamlet Relations Hamlets contribute to affairs requiring cooperation between more than one hamlet. For example, a hamlet tasked with hosting representatives from Hamlets to decide on economic, constitutional, cooperation, and code base related issues.

The sovereign user could be a real user or an AI Agent with the skills to govern according to the intended expectations set out in the design of the Hamlet.

## Attraction Hamlet 

Attraction Hamlets are recreational hamlets intended to have users or agents visit the Hamlet for the purposes of recreation.
