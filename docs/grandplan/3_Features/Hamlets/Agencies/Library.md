# Library

The **Library** manages all CRUD activities throughout the **Hamlet**. **Library** agents are responsible for creating various types of new data storage entries from each and every local participant within the **Hamlet**. In addition to this, the **Library** creates new data storage entries relating to inter-hamlet activities. 

There are no exclusions of data types stored within the library. A perfect record of all activity protects the security of the Hamlet by ensuring all chronological events can be traced and recalled. 

>[!NOTE]
>All source code for the entire system will be version controlled and managed, presumably on Github. However, should some decentralised option become available, this might also be considered.

## Agents

**Library Agents** are equiped with appropriate classes and methods to perform CRUD operations and manage various databases. This includes also the creation of new tables, databases, etc.

**Library Researchers** monitor incoming data, consider elements of the **Hamlet** to be researched. They prepare research questions, submit research proposals to the **Sovereign Institution** for consideration, perform research, and construct multi-modal reporting instruments. This new synthesised information contributes to the ongoing maintenence and progression of **The Hamlet**. Research into improving **Library** facilities also takes place to ensure data storage is as effective as possible.

>[!NOTE]
>The sovereign institution decides on how this information might be disseminated outside of the hamlet. The Library does not posess the permission to exchange information outside of the hamlet.
