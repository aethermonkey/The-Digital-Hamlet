# Bank

## Overview

The bank acts in an analagous way to conventional real world banks. There are **lending agents** that accept proposals from **resident agents**. The **lending agents** assess proposals on the balance of risk and benefit. If a proposal is deamed approved, the local currency is lent to the **resident agent** to complete the project. The project is *followed* by the **Bank** and progressive outcomes are reported to various agencies for the purposes of maintaining and developing more capable **resident agents**.

## Agents

### Lender

As mentioned above, the **lending agent** assesses proposals, approves or rejects proposals, and lends out local currency to **resident agents** to complete projects.

#### Measures of Success

Unlike realworld lending and business operations, the metric for indicating success of a project is not just limited to monetary profit. The **VeritasSuprema** dictates all manor of aspirational outcomes, whether related to user wellbeing, actual financial gain, boring administrative lifey stuff like reminders, bill payments, etc.

#### Proposals

**Proposals** are submitted to be reviewed when **resident agents** plan formally, addressing some criteria. Some criteria include:

- Agent / profession
- Intended articles the project aims to satisfy
- SWOT analysis
- Stakeholders
- Collaborators and other services
- Budget (local currency)
    - Budget for network crypto currency, real world currency, or both.
- Plan
- Intended outcomes
- Expected metric for success
- Expected timeline

>[!NOTE]
>This is by no means an exhaustive list of criteria

### Manager

The **Bank Manager** assesses statistics about lending, project successes and failures, and cooperates with the **Central Bank** in regulating and maintaining a healthy local economy. 

## Data Storage

All transactions, proposals, assessments, and other records relating to the work of the bank are recorded in the **Library**. Centralising data storage to the **Library** ensures that other agencies have a centralised point of reference for intra and inter-hamlet information that relates to financial activities related to the node.
