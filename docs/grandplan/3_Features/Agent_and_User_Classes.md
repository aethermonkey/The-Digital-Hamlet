# Agent and User Classes in Holochain

In Holochain, both users and AI agents would have cryptographic identities. In the Holochain framework, every participant, whether a human user or an AI agent, is represented by an agent ID, which is derived from their cryptographic public key. This design ensures that every action taken on the network can be securely attributed to a specific entity, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and trust in a decentralized system.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might structure your Holochain application to accommodate both human users and AI agents:

1. **Agent Identity**: Every participant in the Holochain network, whether a human user or an AI agent, has a unique cryptographic keypair (public and private keys). The public key serves as the agent's identity (agent ID) on the network.

2. **User Profiles**: You can create a `user_profile` entry type in your `identity` zome that stores information about human users, such as their name, avatar, and bio. This entry is signed by the user's private key and can be retrieved using their public key.

3. **AI Agent Profiles**: Similarly, you can create an `ai_agent_profile` entry type that stores information about AI agents, such as their name, purpose, and capabilities. This entry would also be signed by the AI agent's private key, which would be managed by the system or the human user that controls the AI agent.

4. **Capabilities**: Both human users and AI agents can perform actions within the network according to their capabilities. These actions are always signed by the entity's private key to ensure authenticity.

5. **Permissions**: You can define different roles and permissions for human users and AI agents within your application logic. For example, certain actions might be restricted to human users, while others could be automated by AI agents.

6. **Interactions**: Both human users and AI agents can interact with each other through the Holochain DHT. For instance, an AI agent could autonomously perform tasks on behalf of a user or communicate with other agents as part of its programmed behavior.

To start implementing this structure, you would begin by defining the necessary entry types and validation rules in your zomes. Here's a simplified example of what the entry definitions might look like in Rust, which is the primary language used for developing zomes in Holochain:

```rust
#[hdk_entry(id = "user_profile")]
pub struct UserProfile {
    name: String,
    avatar: String,
    bio: String,
}

#[hdk_entry(id = "ai_agent_profile")]
pub struct AIAgentProfile {
    name: String,
    purpose: String,
    capabilities: Vec<String>,
}
```

Each profile would be created with a `create_entry` function call and would be retrievable by its entry hash or agent ID. The validation rules would ensure that profiles are created and updated according to the application's logic, such as verifying that a user profile can only be updated by the user who owns it.

By following this approach, you can build a flexible system where both human users and AI agents coexist within the same Holochain application, each with their own cryptographic identities and capabilities.
