# Interoperability and Standards

The Digital Hamlet framework is built with interoperability at its core, ensuring seamless integration and communication with other systems and networks. By adhering to global standards, the framework facilitates compatibility and enables users to connect with a wide range of services and communities.

Key aspects of interoperability and standards include:

- **Adherence to Protocols:** The framework follows established protocols such as ActivityPub for social networking, IPFS for distributed file storage, and Holochain's DHT for decentralized data storage, ensuring that it can interact with other systems using the same protocols.

- **Use of Open Standards:** Open standards are employed wherever possible to promote transparency, reduce the risk of vendor lock-in, and encourage community contributions.

- **Data Portability:** Users can easily export and import their data in standard formats, allowing them to switch between different platforms without losing their information.

- **APIs and SDKs:** The framework provides well-documented APIs and SDKs that adhere to industry best practices, enabling developers to create interoperable applications and services.

- **Semantic Web Technologies:** By utilizing semantic web technologies like Schema.org, the framework ensures that data is structured and can be understood by other systems, enhancing discoverability and integration.

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** The use of DIDs allows for verifiable, self-sovereign identities that can be recognized across different systems and services.

- **Smart Contract Compatibility:** For systems that require blockchain-based transactions, the framework can interact with smart contracts, following standards such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 for token interoperability.

Through these measures, the Digital Hamlet framework ensures that it remains a flexible, extensible, and future-proof platform that can easily adapt to new standards and technologies as they emerge.
