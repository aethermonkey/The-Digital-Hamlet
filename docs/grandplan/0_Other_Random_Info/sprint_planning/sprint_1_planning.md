# Sprint 1 Planning

## Team Members
- Product Owner: Responsible for defining and prioritizing the agent stories.
- Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process and removes any blockers the team is facing.
- Development Team: Responsible for developing the software. This includes:
  - Backend Developers: Work on the server-side logic and database interactions.
  - Frontend Developers: Work on the user interface and user experience.
  - QA Testers: Ensure the quality of the software by finding and reporting bugs.

## Sprint Goal
The goal for this sprint is to develop the functionality for the Agent, Library Agent, and Towncenter Agent stories.

## Sprint Backlog
- As an Agent, I want to have an authorisation level that limits my access to information and abilities depending on various factors.
- As a Library Agent, I want to store and manage all knowledge in a structured and searchable format, so that other agents can easily access and use this knowledge.
- As a Towncenter Agent, I want to provide a central bulletin board for all resident agents, so that they can stay informed about hamlet news and changes, and interact with one another.

## Definition of Done
A story is considered done when the code is written, tested, integrated, and can be demonstrated to the Product Owner.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Risk: Unfamiliarity with the technology stack. Mitigation: Provide training and resources for team members to learn the necessary technologies.
- Risk: Unclear requirements. Mitigation: Regular communication with the Product Owner to clarify requirements.
