# Project Plan

## Project Vision
My vision is that The Digital Hamlet, a multi-agent, dynamic and self-improving system, will be my personal guide and assistant; however, it is much more than that. The system will know me about as good as I know myself, if not better.  It will understand my wishes, goals, desires, weaknesses, strengths, etc. The citizens of the hamlet will be guided by the constitution (VeritasSuprema), which is automatically updated based on system knowledge of me (Sovereign User). The constitution isn't a traditional legal framework.  It is a set of rules and principles that reflect my intentions and how I would like the community to act in order to acheive my real world goals.  This means that every agent will act according to the constitution, and will adapt their behaivour based on changes to the document.The vision is that The Digital Hamlet will be a whole community of citizens tasked with assisting and augmenting my real world life.  Everything the do will aim at enriching my life, emotionally, financially, and socially.

## Target Users
At present, I am the only intended user.  This is because at this stage, the project vision is purely to answer the demands of me alone.  The target users will definitely be expanded on. Some ideas are: to make a packaged software that others can install to start their own digital hamlets; visitor users to my hamlet that can see the virtual community in action, and possibly created games and other experiences as the hamlet grows; other potential stakeholders I have yet to think of, perhaps guest appearances, and different levels of authorisation, allowing for things like spectators, or consultants, advisors, etc. 

## Key Features
The hamlet will have a topology of geographical entities such as Library (knowledge database / graph database / hypergraph / vector store), Sovereign institution (direct interaction with me and governance of the system), towncenter (a meeting place and source of information for all resident agents, that informs of hamlet news and changes, advertises ideas to build projects, and acts as a central point for resident agents to interact with one another), bank / economy management (issue local currency as credit, review and accept proposals from resident agents for new projects, loan currency to agents for the development of accepted projects, note that the local currency will be able to facilitate real world currency, perhaps through an intermediary financial instrument), court system (to resolve disagreements, hear cases and make decisions that will either uphold the constitution or ammend the constitution to reflect the new precedents), and ofcourse residents will have their own geographical home locations.  This is just a brief brainstorm of the possible entities. The system will have a time system which can be slowed down or sped up and all entities will function at the simulation time (so I can regulate the pace at which agents operate). A robust knowledge / memory management system that records all conversations between agents and groups of agents, creates knowledge graphs leading to hypergraphs to grow into authentic reasoning and knowledge systems (refer to the work of openCog and Ben Goertzel). Financial API that can manage the transfer of real world funds to and from the hamlet. Regulatory system that monitors and manages all incoming and outgoing messages and interactions between the hamlet and the real world.

## Success Criteria
The project will be successful when the system functions without much intervention from myself, and moreso, when the system can maintain it's own code, improve it's code, govern resident agents appropriately, and has working municpal systems that autonomously respond to the changing environment.

## Constraints
The project uses opensource technology where possible.  Only under absolutely necessary circumstances will the project include proprietary technology.  One example is the use of ChatGPT from OpenAI for large language models. The agents primarily function with llms to communicate, rationalise, collaborate, and reason.  At the moment, opensource models lack the robust and consistent performance of GPT4.  However, the ultimate goal is that only opensource models will be used, and preferrably on local hardware, as all of the information is highly personal, and I believe this sort of system should not be primarily located on a cloud service.  The user needs complete protection and confidence that The Digital Hamlet is as private as the user's own personal thoughts.

## Risks
There is a risk that my vision might not be attainable in any tangible or useful way.  This is obviously a grand vision.  But, as a non-programmer, I am concerned that I am missing a wide body of knowledge to really understand what is required of this system. I am relying on my helpful AI assistant to really understand my requirements, and collaborate in the construction of the finest details pertaining to the grand idea.
