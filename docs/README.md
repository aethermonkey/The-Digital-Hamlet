# Grand Plan

## Background

My name is Ben, and I have ADHD.  I was only diagnosed in recent years (I'm 43 years old), and while medication is great, it is not a cure.  My inspiration to begin planning **The Digital Hamlet** is 2 fold:

### AI Advancement

Principly, LLM technologies are new in the public sphere of understanding, and such a project still requires smarter and more reiliable LLMs.  However, with the advent of code helpers, I thought I might just get started now, anticipating that this time next year (currently November 2023), there would be opensource models fit for puurpose, and able to be run on much lesser machines than that which is required to deliver our best LLM services - think GPT4-Turbo api.

### AI Assistant For me With ADHD

The use of medications for the treatment of ADHD are not a panacea, I have been quick to realise that while I can cope day to day, many, if not most of my symptoms still persist. If only there were a platform that would address my goals and desires in a way that is bespoke to me exclusively. As I learned more about AI agents, and how we could soon be able to incorporate multiple agents to work in collaboration, I wondered what sort of community of AI agents would be creative, productive, and effective. What sort of community could be personal and beautiful in its interactions with me (The Sovereign User). Most of all, I wanted a platform that could understand me aswell as I do, down to the most personal and intimate detail. **The Digital Hamlet** fits that description for me. This maleable and aligning modality would see ai agents all attempt to work towards satisfying the sovereign user and the VeritasSuprema that guides all of those agents 'living' in the Hamlet.

## Collaboration

Any and all constructive collaboration is welcomed. My early experiments and learnings all lacked a clear and direct plan. As such, I regularly moved from repo to repo, always looking for the silver bullet.  Instead, this time I decided to start this repo, with extensive planning documentation before 'putting pen to paper' so to speak - 'breaking ground' is another good idiom.  

My hope is that others will see my vision and contribute to helping me where my own skills have failed. I can use GIT in a basic sense, and my coding skills are not novice, but surely lack the abilities of professionals, and people with more time on their hands. Please message me if I need a point in the right direction. This project needs more people that understand how a lofty goal such as this is planned, started, iterated, and ultimately deployed.
