Got it, here is an expanded summary with that additional context:

- The goal is to build a Digital Hamlet using AI agents designed by the Architect AI. 

- To do this, the Architect AI first needs to implement a robust memory system to maintain conversation context.

- After sorting out short and long-term memory, the Architect will build the required AI agents for the Digital Hamlet team roles.

- The roles decided are: Product Owner agent, Scrum Master agent, Development Team agents (design, dev, testing), and Sovereign Advisor agent. 

- The Architect will be the temporary Sovereign Advisor agent until a dedicated one is built.

- The Architect memory system will store all conversations in a database and extract key details using NLP. 

- These details will be summarized and condensed into inputs for the Product Owner and Development Team agents.

- This will help the Architect gain a nuanced understanding of the Sovereign's vision to advise the Product Owner agent effectively.

- The next MOST IMPORTANT step is building this memory system for the Architect before creating the other AI agents.
