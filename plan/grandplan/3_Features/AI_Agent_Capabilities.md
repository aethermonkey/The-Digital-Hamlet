# AI Agent Capabilities

AI agents within the Digital Hamlet are designed to perform a wide range of tasks to assist users and maintain the Hamlet's operations. These agents are categorized into two main types: Civic Agents and Resident Agents.

## Civic Agents
Civic Agents are responsible for managing and maintaining core services within the Hamlet. They are akin to the public service agencies in a traditional government and are divided into different agencies, each with a specific focus area. For example:

- **Library Agency:** Manages the storage and retrieval of knowledge within the Hamlet.
- **Judicial Agency:** Oversees the dispute resolution process and maintains the rule of law according to the Hamlet's constitution.
- **Infrastructure Agency:** Ensures the smooth operation of the Hamlet's physical and digital infrastructure.
- **Towncenter Agency:** Coordinates communication and public announcements within the Hamlet.
- **Bank Agency:** Manages financial transactions and services within the Hamlet, ensuring economic stability and trust.
- **Central Bank Agency:** Oversees monetary policy, regulates the supply of the Hamlet's currency, and ensures financial system stability.
- **Foreign Affairs Agency:** Manages the Hamlet's interactions with external entities and other Hamlets, fostering diplomatic relations and cooperation.
- **Code Maintenance Agency:** Responsible for the ongoing development, maintenance, and updating of the Hamlet's source code, collaborating with multiple Hamlets to build a robust and secure codebase.

## Resident Agents
Resident Agents are akin to the citizens of the Hamlet. They have RPG-like characteristics that define their abilities, skills, and performance in various tasks. These characteristics might include:

- **Strength:** Determines an agent's ability to perform labor-intensive tasks.
- **Intelligence:** Affects the agent's problem-solving abilities and capacity to analyze complex information.
- **Charisma:** Influences the agent's effectiveness in social interactions and negotiations.
- **Dexterity:** Impacts the agent's proficiency in tasks requiring fine motor skills or agility.

Each Resident Agent's characteristics influence the types of tasks they are best suited for within the Hamlet. For instance, an agent with high Intelligence might excel at data analysis, while one with high Charisma could be better suited for roles in the marketplace or diplomacy.

Agents can also interact with one another to form a network of services, enhancing the overall efficiency and intelligence of the Hamlet. Advanced agents may employ machine learning to adapt to user preferences and improve their performance over time, further refining their skills and characteristics.
