# External Systems

External systems facilitate interaction with the broader network of Hamlets and other external services. Key components include:

- **holochain**: the backbone of the decentralized network of hamlets. 
- **ActivityPub**: For social networking and communication between Hamlets.
- **IPFS**: For distributed file storage and sharing across the network.
- **Digital Currency Protocols**: Standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 for token interoperability and transactions.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language (optional for additional consensus)
