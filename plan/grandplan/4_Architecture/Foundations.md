## Local Hamlet Infrastructure:

### Data storage: 
Holochain's distributed hash table stores data across nodes
### Messaging: 
Holochain's DHT handles encrypted peer-to-peer messaging
### Applications: 
Built as Holochain applications using languages like Rust
### Identity: 
Nodes have cryptographic identities provided by Holochain
### File Storage: 
IPFS could provide distribution, but may not be required locally

## External Connectivity:

Holochain's DHT allows peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes

ActivityPub enables interoperability with outside decentralized networks

DIDs could help with external identity interoperability
Bridging Local & External:

"Border Agent" application routes messages and files according to permissions
User defines permission profiles for each Agent type (read, send, etc.)

Border Agent only allows information flow as specified in profiles

Profiles can be modified by User at any time to tighten/loosen access
Additional Features:

"Policy Agent" assists User in defining profiles and governance policies

"Watchdog Agent" monitors all information flows and alerts User

Schemas like Schema.org promote common data vocabularies

This foundation utilizes Holochain's robust capabilities for the local infrastructure while maintaining the user's control over external connections. All components work together in a decentralized manner without unnecessary dependencies.
