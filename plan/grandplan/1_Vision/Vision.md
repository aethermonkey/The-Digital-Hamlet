# A Vision for Decentralized Digital Communities

The Digital Hamlet framework seeks to empower individuals through the creation of decentralized autonomous sociotechnical communities online. The user is the sole occupant of a Hamlet, and the Hamlet learns and develops inline with the user, forever striving to enrich the life of the individual. At its core are the following components:

## Hamlet Nodes  

Each Hamlet is an independent node running Holochain as a distributed hash table for data storage and validation. Libp2p enables peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes to form an encrypted overlay network. IPFS hosts permanent files, while Whisper allows for private communications.

## Intra-Hamlet Activity

Within a Hamlet, autonomous AI agents and human users interact through a decentralized marketplace and message boards stored on the Holochain DHT. This facilitates tasks, trades, and collaboration. The sovereign user provides oversight and guidance.

## Inter-Hamlet Links

Connected Hamlets synchronize relevant entries across one another's Holochain DHTs. Social relationships are represented through ActivityPub. Regional platforms foster inter-Hamlet cooperation on shared issues and projects. 

## VeritasSuprema (constitutions) & Global coordination

A DAG consensus system like IOTA ensures harmonization at an internet scale. Constitutional conventions bring representatives together to draft amendments vetted through localized ratification processes.

Each Hamlet generates a unique VeritasSuprema constitution defined by its sovereign user. These local constitutions are enforced through smart contracts on the Holochain DHT.

Representatives periodically convene constitutional conventions to discuss region-specific topics. They jointly draft proposed amendments which require ratification votes from interconnected hamlets.

Ratified updates are integrated into each hamlet's constitution as optional shared rules/guidelines at the regional scale. This facilitates coordination on common challenges.

Global conventions propose amendments vetted through iterative feedback. Upon consensus, updates trigger smart contract changes propagating amendments uniformly yet flexibly across all hamlet constitutions.

By employing a standardized constitutional schema and semantic ontologies, frameworks can automatically parse, merge and propagate localized, regional and global elements over time.

This balances ideological diversity across sovereign hamlets with means for representatives to identify mutual interests and discuss approaches to boundary issues in a deliberative process. It helps avoid fragmentation while respecting self-determination.

The evolving multi-level VeritasSuprema system aims to cultivate harmonization without compromising each hamlet community's autonomy or unique character. Local guides global in a coherent constitutional structure.

## Digital economies

Each Hamlet mints its own localized currency, while a shared global currency enables borderless value exchange. Dual cryptocurrency systems balance localized autonomy and distributed participation.

## Dispute resolution

Local hamlet disputes are essentially where an ai agent has in someway challenged or contravened the VeritasSuprema.  The framework provides a court like system for agents to have their case heard. Decisions in these cases then modify the VeritasSuprema.

Likewise, it could be envisioned that at a regional scale, some technical solution might allow for fluid resolution of disputes.

## Governance structures

Decentralized governance facilitates constitutional evolution and regional coordination within a overarching schema to maintain sovereignty and enable scaling. Representation and deliberative processes promote coordination.

## Agents and users

Autonomous AI agents carry out tasks and activities within ethical and legal paradigms defined by sovereign human users. Dashboards provide oversight and tools for participatory guidance of Hamlet dynamics.  

## Network Structure

Hamlets (nodes) are connected via subnets which represent groupings of interest aligned individiuals. Subnets can group further arbitrarily. The primary conception is that common beliefs, ideologies, and goals of individuals can organically draw together likeminded groups in a collaborative and self-organising fashion.

## Interoperability

While still early stages, there ought to be a way for this foundational framework to branch off and allow other similar frameworks to coincide heterogeneously.

What standards facilitate semantic understanding across variations?

## Security and privacy 

Identity keys and encryption protocols like Whisper ensure authenticated and confidential communications within and across Hamlets. Redundancy and fallback strategies help maintain resilience against potential attacks or disruptions.

By implementing emerging decentralized technologies through a holistic framework, Digital Hamlets aim to realize Living Networks - harmonized yet self-determined communities as autonomous nodes promising emancipatory potential at a global scale.

## Maintenance and sustainability

The Digital Hamlet Framework will be underpinned by a specific department of ai agents tasked with further developing, maintaining, and updating the underlying sourcecode.  This role will be entrusted to founding hamlets initially.  Longterm, the framework will adjust who is granted this prestigious role based on a wider consensus, always ensuring the platform is updated autonomously, and with the best interest of the users.  There enlies the possibility for subnets to essentially create their own forks, where the code between subnets might change.  

However, there will need to remain a high tier standard that is upheld by all to atleast ensure interoperability between all hamlets on the network.
