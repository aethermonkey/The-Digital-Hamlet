# Holochain Architecture for Digital Hamlet

## Overview

The Holochain framework will serve as the backbone for the decentralized Digital Hamlet, enabling peer-to-peer networking, data integrity, and autonomous agent interactions. Each Hamlet will be an independent Holochain application with its own DNA, consisting of multiple zomes that encapsulate specific functionalities.

## DNAs

### HamletNodeDNA
- **Description**: This DNA represents the core identity and functionality of a Hamlet.
- **Zomes**:
  - `identity`: Manages user identities and agent keys.
  - `communication`: Handles messaging and social interactions.
  - `governance`: Facilitates constitutional processes and decision-making.
  - `economy`: Manages local currencies and transactions.
  - `dispute_resolution`: Provides mechanisms for resolving conflicts within the Hamlet.

TODO: Define the specific capabilities and entry types for each zome.

### VeritasSupremaDNA
- **Description**: This DNA governs the constitutional framework of a Hamlet.
- **Zomes**:
  - `constitution`: Manages the constitutional documents and amendment processes.
  - `ratification`: Handles the voting and consensus mechanisms for changes.

TODO: Specify the data validation rules and consensus protocols.

## Zomes

### Identity Zome
- **Capabilities**: Manages user profiles, agent public keys, and identity verification.
- **Entry Types**: `user_profile`, `agent_key`, `verification_record`

TODO: Implement identity verification protocols and integrate with external identity services.

### Communication Zome
- **Capabilities**: Enables direct messaging, public posts, and encrypted communications.
- **Entry Types**: `message`, `post`, `encryption_key`

TODO: Design the encryption and privacy model for secure communications.

### Governance Zome
- **Capabilities**: Supports the creation and modification of local constitutions and governance structures.
- **Entry Types**: `constitution_document`, `amendment_proposal`, `governance_policy`

TODO: Develop a flexible amendment proposal system that can handle various types of changes.

### Economy Zome
- **Capabilities**: Manages the issuance, transfer, and accounting of local digital currencies.
- **Entry Types**: `currency`, `transaction`, `account_balance`

TODO: Integrate with external blockchain or DLT systems for global currency interoperability.

### Dispute Resolution Zome
- **Capabilities**: Provides a framework for adjudicating disputes and updating the VeritasSuprema.
- **Entry Types**: `dispute_case`, `resolution`, `veritas_update`

TODO: Create a transparent and fair dispute resolution process that aligns with the VeritasSuprema.

## Integration with External Systems

The Holochain architecture must ensure seamless integration with external systems such as IPFS for file storage, ActivityPub for social networking, and various digital currency protocols.

TODO: Define the interfaces and protocols for interoperability with these external systems.

## Security Considerations

Security and privacy are paramount in the design of the Holochain architecture. Measures must be taken to protect user data, ensure secure communications, and prevent unauthorized access.

TODO: Implement robust encryption standards and develop a comprehensive security audit plan.

## Conclusion

The Holochain architecture for the Digital Hamlet is designed to be modular, secure, and adaptable to the evolving needs of decentralized communities. By carefully defining the DNAs and zomes, we can create a resilient and flexible framework that empowers users and fosters collaboration.

TODO: Continuously review and update the architecture to incorporate new technologies and address emerging challenges.
