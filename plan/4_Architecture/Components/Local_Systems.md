# Local Systems

The local systems within a Digital Hamlet are designed to operate independently and provide all necessary services for the Hamlet's functioning. These systems include:

- **Holochain**: For distributed data storage and peer-to-peer application logic.
- **Local Database**: A combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to store and manage local data efficiently.
- **Agent Foundry**: The development and maintenance hub for AI agents within the Hamlet.
- **Messaging System**: A secure and private messaging system for communication between agents and users.
- **Identity Management**: A decentralized identity system that provides verifiable identities for users and agents.
- **File Storage**: A local file storage system that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of digital assets.
- **Application Services**: Core services that support the operation of the Hamlet, including financial transactions, governance, and marketplace functionality.
- **Security Infrastructure**: Measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data and communications within the Hamlet.
- **Maintenance and Update Mechanisms**: Systems in place for the regular maintenance and updating of the Hamlet's infrastructure and applications.

These local systems are designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, ensuring the smooth operation of the Digital Hamlet and providing a foundation for its growth and evolution.
