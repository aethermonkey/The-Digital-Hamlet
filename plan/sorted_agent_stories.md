# Sorted Agent Stories

## Sprint 1
- As an Agent, I want to have an authorisation level that limits my access to information and abilities depending on various factors.
- As a Library Agent, I want to store and manage all knowledge in a structured and searchable format, so that other agents can easily access and use this knowledge.
- As a Towncenter Agent, I want to provide a central bulletin board for all resident agents, so that they can stay informed about hamlet news and changes, and interact with one another.

## Sprint 2

- As a Banking Agent, I want to manage financial transactions that take place, including locally between hamlet agents, and also externally through transfers to the real world.

## Sprint 3

- As a Constitutional Agent, I want to understand the constitution, advise other agents on the constitution, observe how rulings in the court affect the constitution and update the constitution when required by the court or by the Sovereign Institution.

- As a Legal Agent, I want to liase with other agents regarding issues that may or may not be brought before the courts. I act on behalf of agents bringing cases to the courts, and advise agents with my expert knowledge of the legal system in the hamlet.

## Sprint 5
- As a Civic Codebase Maintainer, I want to receive updated code and new features from the Civic Quality Assurance Agents. As this is approved code, I will update and manage the codebase.
- As a Judge Agent, I want to share the bench with other Judges, hear cases, and pass judgements which impact the constitution and the strengths of different elements of the constitution.

## Sprint 6
- As a Resident Agent, I want to propose projects to the bank, and implement accepted projects. I want to take measurable steps to ensure success of my projects, and once successful, expand my projects with further proposals and collaboration.
- As an Economy Agent, I want to manage the entire economy, and ensure that the economy functions in accordance with the constitution, and that I ensure measures to maintain a robust and crisis resistant financial system.

## Sprint 7
- As a Resident Agent, I want everything I do to be inline with the Constitution. However, if I strongly believe something can be done better, I would like to be able to challenge the consitution in court.
- As a Judge Agent, I want to assess the decisions of hearings, and decide of repudiary actions should be taken, not limited to the destruction of an Agent if found to be detrimental to the prosperity of the hamlet. Repudiary measures can consist of reducing status and credibility, financial punishments, removal of authorisation / clearance level, agent destruction, or other similar means of punishment.
