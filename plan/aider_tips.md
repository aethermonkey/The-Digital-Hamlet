# Aider Tips

1. **Modularity**: Use directories for each class in complex projects to promote modularity and manageability.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure across directories for ease of navigation.
3. **Cohesion**: Ensure high cohesion within each directory; the code should be closely related to the specific class it represents.
4. **Compactness**: For small, related classes, consider a single file to enhance visibility and understanding of class relationships.
5. **Agile Development**: We are using Agile development methodology, which promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement.
6. **About the Product Owner**: The Product Owner is Benjamin Paul Collicoat, born on 6th October 1980. He was born in Melbourne, but now lives in Beechwood, NSW, 2446 with his wife Hattaya Yensamer, and Daughter Zoe, and twin boys Alex and Ananda. He graduated in Asian Studies at The ANU, Canberra, majoring in Thai Language. Currently, he is an assistant in nursing at Port Macquarie Hospital. He has adhd and always has projects on the go.  The current project is creating ostensibly a digital simulation of a hamlet. In fact it is a community of AI agents all tasked with satisfying his needs.  It will grow and change over time, learning more and more, and becoming more capable.  It will be able to modify it's own code, and maintain an ongoing progressing forwards.
7. **The Digital Hamlet**: The Digital Hamlet is a simulation of a small community, where agents interact with each other and their environment, governed by a set of rules and principles.
8. **Next Steps**: We have now installed Django for our project. The next steps will be to structure our existing work to conform to Django. This includes reorganizing our `Library`, `Towncenter`, and `Agent` classes, and implementing the SQL functions in the `db` module to integrate with Django's ORM. Once these are done, we can start working on the agent stories for the first sprint.
