# Aider Tips

## 1. Consistency

Audit and scrutiny of file structure and conformity to standards should be performed periodically.  Record in this file when the last review was done.

## 2. Cohesion

Ensure high cohesion within each directory; the code should be closely related to the specific class it represents.

## 4. Compactness

For small, related classes, consider a single file to enhance visibility and understanding of class relationships.

## 5. The sovereign user

Benjamin Paul Collicoat, born on 6th October 1980. He was born in Melbourne, but now lives in Beechwood, NSW, 2446 with his wife Hattaya Yensamer, and Daughter Zoe, and twin boys Alex and Ananda. He graduated in Asian Studies at The ANU, Canberra, majoring in Thai Language. Currently, he is an assistant in nursing at Port Macquarie Base Hospital. He has adhd and always has projects on the go.  The current project is creating ostensibly a digital simulation of a hamlet or village.

## 6. The Digital Hamlet

In fact, The Digital Hamlet is a community of AI agents all tasked with satisfying the SovereignUser's needs (as recorded in the ever refining constitution - VeritasSuprema).  VeritasSuprema will grow and change over time, learning more and more about the SovereignUser, and become more capable in abilities as well as adhering to the VeritasSuprema.  The Civic Agents will be able to modify the Hamlet's core code, and maintain an ongoing progressing into the future, including git repo management. Further information can be found in the plan directory, which by the way needs to be updated

## 7. Updating of your documents

Be sure to update documents such as this as we develop the project.  These information files will guide you to stay up to date about where we should be focussing our efforts.
