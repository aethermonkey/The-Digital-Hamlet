# Aider Tips

1. **Modularity**: Use directories for each class in complex projects to promote modularity and manageability.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure across directories for ease of navigation.
3. **Cohesion**: Ensure high cohesion within each directory; the code should be closely related to the specific class it represents.
4. **Compactness**: For small, related classes, consider a single file to enhance visibility and understanding of class relationships.
