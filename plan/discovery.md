# Discovery Phase

## Defining the Tech Stack
The tech stack for the project will be defined based on the requirements of the project and the expertise of the team. The following questions will help in defining the tech stack:

1. What programming languages does the team have expertise in?
2. What are the specific requirements of the project that might influence the choice of technologies?
3. Are there any preferences for certain types of technologies (e.g., open source vs proprietary)?
4. What databases will be used and why?
5. What frameworks will be used and why?
6. Are there any other technologies that will be used in the project?
