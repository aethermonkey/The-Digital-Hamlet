# Discovery Phase

## Defining the Tech Stack
The tech stack for the project is defined as follows:

1. Programming Languages: Python will be used for both backend and frontend development. The team has expertise in Python and it is versatile and easy to learn.
2. Specific Requirements: The project requires driving agents using Prompt Engineering. Python has libraries like `prompt-toolkit` that can help in building interactive command-line applications.
3. Technology Preferences: Open source technologies are preferred. Python, Flask/Django, and SQL databases are all open source.
4. Databases: SQL will be used for managing relational data. A specific SQL database like PostgreSQL or MySQL may be used.
5. Frameworks: Flask or Django may be used for building the frontend and APIs.
6. Other Technologies: None at this time.
