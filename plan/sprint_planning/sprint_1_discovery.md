## Creating Detailed User Stories
Detailed user stories for the first sprint are as follows:

- As an Agent, I want to have an authorisation level that limits my access to information and abilities depending on various factors.
- As a Library Agent, I want to store and manage all knowledge in a structured and searchable format, so that other agents can easily access and use this knowledge.
- As a Towncenter Agent, I want to provide a central bulletin board for all resident agents, so that they can stay informed about hamlet news and changes, and interact with one another.

These stories will guide the development process for the first sprint. Each story clearly defines who the user is (the agent), what they want (their goal), and why they want it (the benefit). This format helps to keep the focus on the user's needs throughout the development process.
