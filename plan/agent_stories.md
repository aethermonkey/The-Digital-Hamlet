# Agent Stories

## Library

As a Library Agent, I want to store and manage all knowledge in a structured and searchable format, so that other agents can easily access and use this knowledge.

## Sovereign Institution

As a Sovereign Institution Agent, I want to interact directly with the Sovereign User and govern the system according to the constitution, so that the system reflects the user's intentions and goals.

## Towncenter

As a Towncenter Agent, I want to provide a central point of information for all resident agents, so that they can stay informed about hamlet news and changes, and interact with one another.

... (and so on for each geographical entity)
