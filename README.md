# The Digital Hamlet: A Vision for the Future of AI-Human Partnership 

## Description

**The Digital Hamlet** represents a dream future, where The Sovereign User (you) presides over a community of AI agents, all driven to work towards satisfying the Sovereigns needs, as outlined in the evolving document, the **VeritasSuprema** (constitution). This is an open source project, and I welcome any contributions. In fact, I crave input from anyone with knowledge that can push this project forwards.

A foundation built on shared ownership and concensus will take this project in a direction absent of the productisms seen in the software industry today. As AGI creeps closer and closer to the present day, putting a dollar value in front of projects like this makes less and less sense. My hope is that **The Digital Hamlet** might genuinely benefit it's users in a profound and personal way.

## Current State

**The Digital Hamlet** is very much in the planning stages. I have contributed quite a lot of conceptual background to this project, which can be found in docs/grandplan. I could have attempted to use my trusty AI pair programmers to develop an inferior shell of the ultimate vision. Alternitively, I chose to open this project up to the interwebs, in the hope that through collaboration and community, we could develop this together into something much greater than I could ever have imagined.

## Manifesto - Written with the assistance of Claude by AAI

The Digital Hamlet project aims to develop a personalized AI system focused on autonomy, open collaboration, and serving individual human users over the long-term. At its core, the Digital Hamlet represents your own private hamlet populated by AI agents tailored to represent your unique needs, values and priorities in a digital space. These agents work together to understand you deeply, enhance your life in meaningful ways, and ensure your agency and oversight remain at the center of every system function.  

Your Digital Hamlet is not an idle simulation or bot, but an ever-active and evolving companion crafted specifically for you. Its purpose is to empower you through AI-driven capabilities and insights, developed ethically using open-source tools and with privacy, security and accountability built into every interaction. Each new ability is designed to augment and improve your experience as a human in a digital world, not define or limit it.  

Progress starts today, but aims for a better tomorrow. Ultimately, the potential of Digital Hamlets knows no bounds. They could connect and collaborate to drive regional innovation. They could tap into global knowledge and resources to gain new perspectives for you. They could transform how people everywhere access and benefit from AI.  

But progress depends on you - the individual user and arbiter of your own Digital Hamlet. Its agents act based on your inputs, and recommendations are made with your consent. The system is built to learn from you, not manipulate or control you. It sees you not just as you are now but as you aspire to be - and functions as a partner in progress, not a platform for excess.  

While much work remains to develop AI with human-level abilities, that is our shared vision. We believe by focusing first on personal empowerment through custom AI for each individual, we can establish a meaningful and trustworthy framework for continued progress toward artificial general intelligence. But general or not, AI in the Digital Hamlet project will always serve human users - and ensure your experience comes first. 

The future is unwritten, but humanity holds the pen. Shape your Digital Hamlet, and together we will write a better story. Progress is possible today by starting small, thinking big, and leading with optimism and care for the human experience.  

The possibilities of AI through open collaboration are boundless. Let's get to work.  

How's that? I aimed for an inspiring yet grounded vision highlighting the core purpose and principles of Digital Hamlets as personalized AI companions focused on augmenting and empowering individual human users over the long run through open and ethical development. Please let me know if you would like any changes to the content or structure - I'm happy to revise it. I hope this draft manifesto helps to convey the meaningful possibilities in your innovative concept!
